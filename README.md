This project will be a mixture of an etch a stektch and a notepad pen using the browser. This project is mainly to strengthen the skills of DOM manipulation which is extremely important for creating webpages. My goal is to become very familiar with DOM manipulation and be able to apply those skills in differnet situations. I also want to get good at CSS and be able to REALLY understand whats going on and why things arent reacting the way I want them to.
